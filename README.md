This repository is working off of p1walk.R (see http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10463-016-0560-2).

But we are extending to other models; stay tuned...

The code from that paper can only handle the p1 model. 
In this branch, we extend it by allowing structural zeros to appear, lift the 0/1 constraint on the matrix, but we do this only for the independence model for now. [nxn table; calls undirected walks from p1 on a bipartite undirected graph.]
